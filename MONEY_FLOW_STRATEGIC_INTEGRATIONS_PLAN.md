  documentImages: DocumentImage[];
  biometricData?: BiometricVerification;
  verificationLevel: 'basic' | 'enhanced' | 'premium';
}

// Integration with existing customer onboarding
const verifyCustomerIdentity = async (customerId: string, kycData: KYCVerificationRequest) => {
  // Trulioo API integration
  const verificationResult = await truliooClient.verifyPerson({
    countryCode: 'GH', // Ghana
    document: kycData.documentImages[0],
    person: kycData.personalInfo,
    configuration: 'ghana_kyc_standard'
  });
  
  // Update customer record with verification status
  await updateCustomerVerificationStatus(customerId, verificationResult);
}
```

#### Phase 2: Business Verification (KYB) for Tenants (Months 2-3)
**Tenant Verification System**
- Implement Trulioo's Business Verification API for tenant organizations
- Verify business registration with Ghana Registrar-General's Department

## 2. CREDIT SCORING & RISK ASSESSMENT

### 2.1 Ghana Credit Bureau Integration

#### Current Landscape Analysis
**Primary Provider: XDS Data Ghana**
- Ghana's first licensed credit bureau (established 2004)
- API integration capabilities available
- **Critical Limitation**: Credit scoring awaiting Ghana Card adoption (currently 35% penetration)
- Expected full rollout: End of 2024 when Ghana Card penetration reaches ~90%

#### Phase 1: Credit Report Integration (Immediate - Months 1-2)
**XDS Data Ghana API Integration**
- Implement credit report retrieval for loan applicants
- Real-time credit history access during application process
- Automated credit report parsing and risk assessment
- Integration with existing loan origination workflow

**Technical Implementation**
```typescript
interface CreditReportRequest {
  personalInfo: {
    firstName: string;
    lastName: string;
    dateOfBirth: string;
    nationalId: string; // Ghana Card or Passport
    phoneNumber: string;
  };
  consentTimestamp: Date;
  reportType: 'basic' | 'comprehensive';
}

const fetchCreditReport = async (applicantId: string, request: CreditReportRequest) => {
  // XDS Data API integration
  const creditReport = await xdsClient.getCreditReport({
    ...request.personalInfo,
    reportFormat: 'json'
  });
  
  // Store and analyze report
  await storeCreditReport(applicantId, creditReport);
  return analyzeCreditProfile(creditReport);
}
```

#### Phase 2: Alternative Scoring Models (Months 2-4)
**Multi-Source Credit Assessment**
- **Jenga API Integration**: Pan-African aggregated scoring
- **Bank Statement Analysis**: Cash flow-based creditworthiness assessment
- **Mobile Money Transaction Analysis**: Alternative credit scoring using mobile payment patterns
- **Social Credit Indicators**: Employment verification, utility payments, rent history

**Algorithmic Credit Scoring Engine**
```typescript
interface CreditScoringModel {
  traditionalCredit: number;      // XDS Data report (weight: 40%)
  cashFlowAnalysis: number;       // Bank statements (weight: 25%)
  mobileMoney: number;            // Transaction patterns (weight: 20%)
  socialIndicators: number;       // Employment, utilities (weight: 15%)
}

const calculateCompositeScore = (data: CreditScoringModel): CreditScore => {
  const weightedScore = 
    (data.traditionalCredit * 0.4) +
    (data.cashFlowAnalysis * 0.25) +
    (data.mobileMoney * 0.2) +
    (data.socialIndicators * 0.15);
    
  return {
    score: Math.round(weightedScore),
    grade: scoreToGrade(weightedScore),
    riskCategory: determineRiskCategory(weightedScore),
    confidence: calculateConfidence(data)
  };
}
```

### 2.2 Algorithmic Loan Approval Decision Engine

#### Decision Framework Architecture
**Multi-Tier Decision System**
- **Tier 1**: Automated approval for low-risk, small loans (<$1,000)
- **Tier 2**: AI-assisted review for medium-risk applications ($1,000-$10,000)
- **Tier 3**: Committee review for high-value or complex loans (>$10,000)

#### AI-Powered Decision Model
```typescript
interface LoanDecisionFactors {
  creditScore: number;
  debtToIncomeRatio: number;
  collateralValue: number;
  businessCashFlow: number;
  industryRisk: number;
  macroeconomicFactors: number;
  behavioralScore: number;
}

class LoanDecisionEngine {
  async evaluateApplication(applicationId: string): Promise<LoanDecision> {
    const factors = await this.gatherDecisionFactors(applicationId);
    const riskAssessment = this.calculateRisk(factors);
    const decision = this.makeDecision(riskAssessment);
    
    return {
      decision: decision.outcome,
      confidence: decision.confidence,
      recommendedAmount: decision.adjustedAmount,
      interestRate: this.calculatePricingAdjustment(riskAssessment),
      conditions: decision.conditions,
      reasoning: decision.explanation
    };
  }
  
  private calculateRisk(factors: LoanDecisionFactors): RiskAssessment {
    // Machine learning model for risk prediction
    const mlScore = this.mlModel.predict(factors);
    const ruleBasedScore = this.applyBusinessRules(factors);
    
    return this.combineScores(mlScore, ruleBasedScore);
